  <h1><strong>Our Story</strong></h1>

  <p>
    Our project, called <strong>HopeLine</strong>, was created to help and support teenagers who suffer from
    depression and may not have access to professional mental health care. Many teenagers feel uncomfortable
    asking for help or cannot afford therapy sessions, so we wanted to build a safe and friendly website where
    they could learn about their feelings, understand mental health issues, and find emotional support.
  </p>

  <p>
    The website includes a short test to help users understand their condition, helpful educational articles,
    and the ability to book free therapy sessions with volunteer therapists. Working on this project allowed us
    to combine creativity and technology for a meaningful purpose.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>How the Project Started</h2>

  <p>
    Our first task was to choose a topic that was both meaningful and useful to our community. After discussing
    several ideas, we agreed to focus on teenagers’ mental health. Depression among young people is increasing,
    and many teens suffer in silence. We believed that creating a supportive online platform could make a real
    difference.
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of the project requirements, we developed a multi-page website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
    Bootstrap, and Figma. Our website includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A Home Page that introduces our mission and services and includes a validation-based registration form.</li>
    <li>Three topic pages that explain depression, provide booking services, and offer self-care resources such as videos and articles.</li>
    <li>A Making Of page that explains our design choices, mock-ups, and technical decisions.</li>
    <li>An Our Story page (this page) reflecting on our journey.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>Challenges We Faced</h2>

  <p><strong>Small team size:</strong>  
    Our group only had three members, which meant that each person had to handle several responsibilities.
    Balancing design work, development, and academics was difficult at times.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How we solved it:</strong>  
    We divided the tasks based on individual strengths and supported one another throughout the project.
    Good communication helped us manage the workload effectively.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Design challenges:</strong>  
    We wanted the website to feel calming and supportive without being overwhelming. Choosing the right colors
    and layout required careful thought.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How we solved it:</strong>  
    We researched color psychology, watched tutorials, and tested multiple designs in Figma before settling on
    a calm and welcoming theme.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Technical difficulties:</strong>  
    Using JavaScript for validation and organizing our HTML and CSS code was challenging at times. Small errors
    caused layout and form issues.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How we solved it:</strong>  
    We used debugging tools, searched for solutions online, watched tutorials, and asked tutors for guidance.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>What We Learned</h2>

  <p>
    This project improved our technical skills in:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>HTML structure and layout</li>
    <li>CSS styling and responsiveness</li>
    <li>JavaScript form validation</li>
    <li>Bootstrap components</li>
    <li>Mock-up design using Figma</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We also learned the importance of communication, teamwork, and organisation. Each member’s contribution
    was vital to the project’s success.
  </p>

  <p>
    When problems occurred, we did not panic. Instead, we tested solutions patiently and learned from our
    mistakes.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    In conclusion, HopeLine was more than a technical project; it was a meaningful journey. Despite challenges
    such as a small team and technical difficulties, we succeeded through cooperation and persistence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most importantly, this project reminded us that technology can be used to support mental health awareness
    and help others. HopeLine represents care, hope, and a reminder that no one has to struggle alone.
