<h1>Making Of HopeLine</h1>

<p>
The website HopeLine was designed as an educational and informational mental-health support platform aimed at teenagers and young adults. The main objective of the website is to provide users with trustworthy mental-health information, emotional encouragement, and access to supportive resources in a safe and friendly environment.

As part of the design process, low-fidelity mock-ups were created using a design tool rather than HTML. These mock-ups were used to plan the layout, navigation structure, and content organization before the development stage began. This approach helped the group visualize the website structure, identify potential design issues early, and ensure a consistent user experience across all pages.
</p>

<h2>Website Color Palette</h2>

    <div class="justification">
        <h3>Color Design Justification</h3>

        <p>
These colors directly influence how users emotionally interact with the website. 
Using soft blue tones reduces anxiety, while yellow introduces optimism, helping teenagers feel safe and encouraged.
</p>


        <ul>
            <li><strong>Light Blue (#B3E5FC):</strong> 
            Represents calmness, peace, and emotional comfort. It helps users feel relaxed when visiting the website.</li>

            <li><strong>Dark Blue (#0056B3 / #0277BD):</strong> 
            Symbolizes trust, confidence, and reliability. This color is mainly used in navigation bars and titles to build professional credibility.</li>

            <li><strong>Soft Yellow (#FFD54F):</strong> 
            Represents hope, warmth, and positivity. It is used as an accent color to give emotional encouragement.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        This combination was chosen to avoid harsh colors and ensure that users feel emotionally safe and supported while browsing the website.
